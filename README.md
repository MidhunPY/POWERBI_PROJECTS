# 📊 Manufacturing Cost Breakdown – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a **Manufacturing Cost Breakdown dataset** to identify key cost drivers and operational performance indicators. The dashboard provides insights into **cost distribution, production efficiency, machine utilization, scrap rate, and rework costs** to support data-driven manufacturing decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze end-to-end manufacturing cost components
* Identify cost-intensive product categories and plant locations
* Monitor production efficiency and machine utilization
* Track quality metrics such as scrap percentage and rework cost
* Convert raw manufacturing data into actionable business insights

## 💡 Key Business Insights

* Detailed cost breakdown across **materials, labor, overhead, packaging, transportation, quality control, storage, and rework**
* Identification of **high-cost products and plants** for expense control
* Visibility into **machine utilization, downtime, scrap %, and rework cost**
* Insights to improve **operational efficiency and process optimization**
